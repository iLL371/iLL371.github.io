# First task for Kenobi room was to do an nmap scan to show how many ports were open.  I was able to see there are 3 ports open
# My next task was to list the files on the share and found that the available file was log.txt so this was another answer. 
# I was able to identify from the previous nmap scan that FTP is running on port 21. 
# In enumarating port 111 I was able to see what mount was visible and it was /var. Then I moved on to ProFtpd, found version 1.3.5 
# I also located that 4 exploits were being ran by ProFTPd. Using SITE CPFR and SITE CPTO commands to move Kenobi's private key. 
# Then I mounted the directory to the machine I was using and found Kenobi's user flag.  
# For the next task I learned about SUID bits and found how to search for certain types of files and use strings. 
# I was able to manipulate the patch to gain a root shell and found the root flag which allowed me to finish the Kenobi room!
