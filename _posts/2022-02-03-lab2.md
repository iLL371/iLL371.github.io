# Lab 2 Starting out in cybersecurity
# For his lab I was tasked to takeover a BookFace user's account Ben.Spring and use a bruteforce attack to reset the user's password.
# With using the bruteforce tool for a web request repeater I was able to crack the 4 digit reset code.
# This was my first time doing anything like this but it was very interesting to see how it works.
