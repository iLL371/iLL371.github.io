# This room is called WiFi hacking 101
# Background is provided about terms related to WiFi like SSID (network name) and WPA2-EAP (login and password)
# Using Aircrack-ng suite to attack WPA networks, downloaded the task files and began using the suite and capture the information needed.
# Aircrack was a little tricky for me at first but utitlized google search to navigate some of the commands. Even though this room is listed as easy
# It still took me some time to get through it and figure out the answers and eventually find the answers needed to complete the task.
