# Lab 15 TryHackMe room was investigating Windows using various tools within Windows.
# I first went into Powershell as administrator to view system info using "systeminfo" command which provided the what version and year of 
# the Windows machine.  Using "net user" command I found the last user to logon and also the date/timestamp of when John last logged  
# onto the system.  I was able to find the accounts that had admin privileges by using "net localgroup administrators".  I used task 
# scheduler to find that "Clean file system" was the malicious scheduled to run daily by listening to port 1348.  By using event viewer 
# in Windows logs and security I was able to find the date the Windows assigned special privileges to the new logon.  Mimikatz was the tool
# utilized to get Windows passwords.  Next I accessed Windows file in local disk (C:), system32, drivers, hosts and found a file that 
# had various ip address but there was an unusual ip address that says it was for google.com but it was not actually for google.com.
# I went into the Windows firewall and inbound rules and found a rule that allowed outside connections from the public which showed the 
# last port that the attacker used and also finished the room since google.com was the target for DNS poisioning.  This was a good room
# to become more familiar on using the various tools in Windows to investigate an attack.
