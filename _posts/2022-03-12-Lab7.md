title: Lab 7

# Lab 7 involved downloading Keybase.io an app for secure messaging and file sharing.  I used my phone and my spouse's phone for the lab. I created a profile
# of d_iLL371 for myself and cris2226 for my spouses.  We were both able to follow each other on the keybase app.
# After going through each of our devices and after several unsuccessful tries I was finally able to figure out how to use the app I was able to send an encrypted       # and signed message by me from my device to my spouse's. 
# I then received the encrypted file on my spouse's device and had to decrypt it using Saltpack file, after a few attempts I was able to decrypt the message and I was   # able see that I had signed message with the signature I used.
# It was pretty neat to see this in action where you send an encrypted 
# message that you know came from the person it actually was.
