# Lab 3 Common Attacks
# 
# Task 2 discussed social engineering and a case study called Stuxnet-which was a computer virus allegedly created by the USA and Israeli governments
to target the Iran nuclear program.
# Task 3 discussed what Phising is and how actors can send website links that look almost the same as legitimate companies like Amazon or the Royal Mail 
in the United Kingdom. It also explained when one is using a web browser and hovers over a site link it displays the real link at the bottom of your screen. 
Although a site link can look real and legit it can be a mask to the real website which can be malicious. 
# Task 3 also had a phishing test with several potential phishing emails to identify what phising emails can look like and ones that are legitimate.
# Task 4 was about Malware and Ransomware, and referenced the infamous Wannacry ransomware. The task also explained how attackers can send files in 
different formats to trick the user into executed the code.
# Task 5 was about passwords and many errors users make in using easy passwords. It also had really good information about safe password storage
called password hashing which is an industry standard. Additionally, it went on to explain how attackers can use a hash cracker
with a list of likely passwords.
# Task 6 discussed multi-factor authentication and why it is beneficial to use password managers and even provided some common password manager providers.
# Task 7 explained why public wi-fi gives an attacker opportunities to steal sensitive information using a "man in the middle attack" and why using VPN's and websites 
that are encrypted to help with a secure connection.
# Task 8 discussed the importance of taking the appropriate steps to back up your data.  This included the 3-2-1 rule, 3 up to date copies of your data, 
2 backups on different storage mediums and 1 backup on a cloud storage service.
# Task 9 discussed the need to make sure software is up to date and vulnerabilities that can be exploited if you do not, especially with operating systems 
and antivirus software.
